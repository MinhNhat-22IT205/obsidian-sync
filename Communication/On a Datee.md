Mindset: Dive deep into one question + Every conversation is just a challenge, challenge to your current skill & challenge to get better to know the other
So always think: "What can I learn from this person today?"
##### How to be deep?
1. Always assume yourself in a ==selector role== - hỏi ngược lại, be a challenger

2.  Drop the cool guy image, ==be playful== -> to soften the other's feeling
3. To never run out of what to say:
	1. Create the lifeboat, another topic that the other can jump in

4. Focus on the ==feeling==, not the fact inside the telling story
